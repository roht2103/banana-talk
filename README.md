# Banana Talk Converter

Welcome to the "Banana Talk Converter" repository! This delightful application allows you to convert English language into Banana language, the language of the Minions from the popular Despicable Me series. The translation is made possible using the Banana Speak API.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain an API key from the Banana Speak API provider.
3. Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder in the `banana_talk_converter.js` file with your actual API key.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
5. Enter your English text in the input field.
6. Click the "Convert" button to see the Banana language translation.

## Example

Suppose you enter the following English text:

```
Hello, how are you?
```

After clicking the "Convert" button, the application will display:

```
Bello, how banana you?
```

## How It Works

The Banana Talk Converter utilizes the Banana Speak API to translate English text into Banana language. The API request is made with your input text, and the response contains the Minion-style translation.
